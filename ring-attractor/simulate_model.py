simulate_model.py

This script simulates the discrete-time dynamics of the ring-attractor model.
It imports model parameters, angles, connectivity matrix, and initial firing rates from
initialize_model.py. The simulation uses the update rule:

    r(t + dt) = r(t) + dt * [ -r(t) + W Â· r(t) + I_ext(t) ]

where I_ext(t) is a Gaussian bump applied for t < Tinput, and zero afterward.

Note: With the given parameters (W0=-1, W1=3), the effective linear dynamics are unstable,
so firing rates grow exponentially. To avoid numerical overflow (NaNs), we clip r(t) to a maximum
value (here chosen as 100). This is a common numerical safeguard and does not alter the essential dynamics.
